+ Sed is nothing but Stream Editor
	+ Simple commands = pattern + action. 
	  If no pattern is given, the action is applied to all lines, otherwise it is applied only to lines matching the pattern.
	+ This command modifies lines from the specified File according to an edit script and writes them to standard output. 
	+ The sed command includes many features for selecting lines to be modified and making changes only to the selected line

Example: For replacing the word in a file 
		cat file
			I have three dogs and two cats
		+ sed -e 's/dog/cat/g' -e 's/cat/elephant/g' file
		+ sed -e 's/dog/cat/g' -e 's/cat/elephant/g' file
			I have three elephants and two elephants 
			
Example : For writing in to the file

		+ sed -i '2i\Working in Emertxe' filename
			cat filename
			My name is Srinivas
			Working in Emertxe
		it will write in the 2 line in the filename with " Working in Emertxe "

		+ sed -i "2i/srinivas reddy" filenameed 
			This will writes string in the second line

Example : For printing the number of lines from the given file

		+ sed -n '1p' filename 
			prints the starting line from the file

		+ sed -n '1,np' filename
			prints the n number of lines from a file

Example : For Deleting the lines from the given file

		+ sed -i '1d' filename
			which will delete the first line in a filename

		+ sed -i '1,nd' filename
			which will delete n no of lines

		+ sed -i '$d' filename
			Which deletes the last line from the bunch of a file

		+ sed -i '/dolphin/d' filename

		+ sed '/^$/d' file

Extra Options to approach :

		+ $d               # delete the last line of the file
		+ /[0-9]\{3\}/p    # print lines with 3 consecutive digits
		+ 5!s/ham/cheese/  # except on line 5, replace 'ham' with 'cheese'
		+ /awk/!s/aaa/bb/  # unless 'awk' is found, replace 'aaa' with 'bb'
		+ 17,/foo/d        # delete all lines from line 17 up to 'foo'
